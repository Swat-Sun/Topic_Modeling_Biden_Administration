0,BAC_Doc1_Biden-Rescue-Plan.docx,"Biden’s American Rescue Plan fueled inflation. So did post-COVID shortages

The March 2021 Democratic bill included $1,400 payments to about 85% of Americans, $360 billion for state and local governments, and $242 billion in expanded unemployment benefits, among other things.

In the months that followed, inflation has taken off in the U.S. In March, prices were 8.5% higher than 12 months earlier. Even filtering out the cost of food and energy, which can rise and fall quickly, inflation still ran at a yearly rate of 6.4%.

""With no American Rescue Plan, we would still have inflation above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% to 3%,"" Goldwein said.

The post-COVID-19 inflation story is more complicated than just federal spending. Other forces, including changes in the labor market, rising global energy and commodity prices, supply chain dysfunction and the war in Ukraine have all contributed to higher prices.

Estimating the impact of the American Rescue Plan

No magic formula can reveal precisely how much the American Rescue Plan fueled inflation, but the general consensus is that it was a contributor. Some economists estimate that it added two percentage points to the rate, some say it added up to four percentage points. Put another way, out of the 8.5% rate in March, the measure accounted for something between one quarter to one half of inflation.

Between the first and last quarters of 2021, European inflation went up three points. In the same period, U.S. inflation rose more than four points.

The resurging economy outstripped the supply of oil and natural gas, leading to higher energy costs. As the pandemic eased, the economic recovery also triggered shortfalls in the supply of grains and other farm products.

Holtz-Eakin pointed to the moment when the U.S. and Europe parted ways — in the second quarter of 2021. That was right after passage of the American Rescue Plan.

About half of the U.S. increase of four percentage points ""you can easily attribute to the stimulus,"" Holtz Eakin  said.

Other economists estimate higher impacts.

""However, the special factors of the pandemic and war prevent that,"" Baker said. ""And of course, oil is a big part of the problem.""

Another complicating factor is the effect of the spending that came before Biden took office. Two bipartisan COVID-relief packages cost over $3 trillion. Goldwein said it all contributed to inflation, though he thinks the American Rescue Plan added more, because it came as the economy was already springing back. Holtz-Eakin also said that the earlier spending was more in line with the level of economic damage due to the pandemic.

Our ruling

Timken said Biden's spending ""has sent prices skyrocketing.""

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say that it spurred inflation. They differ on the precise scale of its impact, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%.

However, none of the experts we reached, liberal and conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID’s disruptions to labor markets, energy prices and supply-chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse.

We rate this claim Half True."
1,BAC_Doc2_Biden-worsened -Inflation.docx,"Biden’s American Rescue Plan worsened inflation. The question is how much.

With President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda stalled in Congress, the American Rescue Plan — the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill Democrats passed in March 2021 — may stand as his biggest achievement.

Some economists argue, though, that all this came at the cost of making inflation worse. New Consumer Price Index numbers released Wednesday showed prices up 8.3 percent compared to one year before. And “core inflation,” which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.6 percent in just one month.

Inflation has brought with it two big problems. The first is already evident: Because most Americans’ wages haven’t risen enough to keep up with it, real (inflation-adjusted) wages have been declining at the highest rate in four decades.

The US had significantly worse “core” inflation than comparable economies

From 2021 onward, what’s known as “core inflation” has been significantly higher in the US than in other wealthy countries. (Core inflation is a common metric that excludes food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, to try to get a better sense of general price levels and inflation in an economy.)

Michael Strain of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute has estimated the law added 3 percentage points. Dean Baker of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, though, put that number at 1-2 percentage points.

The US also stands out from other countries in a more favorable way: It had a quicker and stronger economic recovery in 2021. That indeed seems to be partly because of the Biden stimulus spending.

International comparisons, though, suggest the US would have bounced back without the American Rescue Plan, though more slowly. “I think we would have had a slower recovery, we would’ve had more suffering along the way,” Furman said in an interview. “But pretty much everyone, including countries that did basically nothing, has recovered. And the side effects [in the US] have been quite problematic.”

The criticisms of the American Rescue Plan

The checks were another issue. Birthed out of a political promise Democrats made to one-up Trump and try to win the Georgia Senate runoffs, the checks totaled about $400 billion in spending, and some of them went to families whose finances were already in fine shape. Giving money to people who don’t need it isn’t necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. But if the consequences are higher inflation and economic woes affecting everyone, well, it is a big deal.

Good intentions don’t always make good policies

In retrospect, it seems that Democrats simply didn’t take this seriously enough back in early 2021. They wrongly concluded that a stimulus far in excess of what models said was necessary was the less risky option. They thought they were still in the “money printer go brrr” era, where there was less pressure to be judicious about where that money was going — so instead of targeting help to those who needed it, they sent hundreds of billions of dollars to well-off Americans and states doing just fine, for political reasons.

But wages haven’t kept up with prices. And if this results in significantly worse economic problems in 2022, 2023, and 2024, not to mention electoral consequences for Democrats, it’s unclear whether it would have been worth it."
2,CMP_Doc1_Consumer_Price_Index.docx,"Consumer Price Index hit a four-decade high in March, a brutal reminder for Democrats of the political headwinds facing them as they seek to keep their majorities in the House and Senate this fall.

Prices rose 8.5% from March 2021 to March 2022, while they increased 1.2% from February to March. Half of the increase in the CPI was due to rising gas prices in March.

The Biden administration had been expecting a bad CPI number. ""We expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily due to Putin's price hike,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

The problem for Biden (and his party) is that it's not at all clear that people care why everything they are trying to buy costs more. All they know is that gas prices are through the roof -- although they are lower this week than last -- and everything they want or need to buy costs more (a lot more) than it did a year ago.

Inflation is such a powerful issue in politics because, unlike, say, foreign policy, it touches every person on a daily basis. You notice when it costs more to fill up your car. Or shop for groceries. Or buy just about anything.

Consider this from Matt Zeitlin, an economics reporter at Grid News, about the details of the CPI report: ""The food at home index rose 10.0 percent over the last 12 months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending March 1981. The index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs increased 13.7 percent over the last year as the index for beef rose 16.0 percent.""

When that happens, you look for someone to blame. And, if past is prologue, you blame the party in charge.

Now, that is, at some level unfair. It is very difficult for the president of the United States to deal with rising inflation -- particularly given the ongoing international crisis occasioned by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

But, what the soaring -- and historically high -- inflation numbers mean is that President Joe Biden's attempts to sell a positive economic story will continue to be badly hamstrung.

Despite unemployment falling to 3.6% in March, the lowest since the start of the pandemic in February 2020, polls suggest that people remain very concerned about the state of the economy.

In Gallup polling last month, more than 1 in 3 people (35%) cited economic issues as the most pressing concern facing the country -- up from just 22% who said the same in January. Of that 35%, almost half -- 17% -- cited rising inflation specifically as the biggest issue confronting the country, more than double the number who said the same in January.

This is a massive political problem for Biden and his party. And, experts predict that the CPI will remain above 6% for the remainder of the year, meaning that it isn't going away as an issue anytime soon.  Tuesday's CPI report is a major dark cloud on the political horizon for Democrats. And there's no obvious way to solve the problem between now and November."
3,CMP_Doc2_Voters_have_made.docx,"Voters have made clear surveys that their attention is focused on soaring gasoline and food prices than on plentiful availability of jobs.  Year-long acceleration of prices in the aftermath of the pandemic recession has left Americans struggling with cost of necessities and dissatisfied with overall economy.

For decades, job growth and unemployment tended to be the top economic metrics by which voters judged presidents. Biden faces a new era in which chronically high inflation has eclipsed a consistently strong job market.

At just 3.6%, the unemployment rate is near a half-century low, and on Friday the government reported that employers added 390,000 more jobs in May — roughly double the pre-pandemic pace. Businesses advertised more than 11 million open jobs in April, down only slightly from a record high in March.

Higher inflation, partly stemming from supply chain snarls and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is causing hardships for Americans, particularly lower-income and Black and Hispanic households, which spend a disproportionate share of their income on gas, rent and food.

Wages have been rising, but not as fast as prices, eroding Americans’ spending power. More people say they’re struggling to pay their weekly bills, according to the Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey.

Even with solid job market, 16 million more households over the past year said they found it difficult to pay their expenses.  More households say they’re getting by with credit cards, spending down their savings or borrowing from others.

The financial strain has grown even as the survey showed a 78% decline in households relying on unemployment benefits — a sign that job growth has been insufficient to offset the problems caused by inflation.

Fear of inflation began to build more than a year ago, according to surveys.  Biden and White House aides initially downplayed the risk that their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package could spark higher inflation. They focused instead on the muscular job growth that followed the government spending.

High inflation has caused more voters to favor reductions in government spending and greater oil and gas production — policies favored by Republican lawmakers. Even if inflation falls from current levels, At the same time, his past claims that inflation would fade have hurt his credibility.

“We want to get something economists call ‘full employment,’ ” Biden said.  “Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employees to compete with each other to attract work.”

The administration achieved that goal. After 22 million jobs were shed in just early 2020, the height of the pandemic, the economy recovered all but 800,000. It took two years — rather than six — for employment to rebound.

Biden’s pandemic relief package contributed to that outcome, economists say. It boosted demand through a round of $1,400 stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits, and child tax credit payments for most parents.

But that level of spending also fueled inflation, as even some economists who have served in Democratic administrations warned it might.  Consumer prices jumped 8.3% in April compared with a year earlier, down from March but still near worst in 40 years. Gas prices have skyrocketed 44% in the past year and are still rising. Groceries are 11% more expensive."
4,DT_Doc1_Biden_Administration_Renewable.docx,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said on Wednesday it would cut in half the amount it charges companies to build wind and solar projects on federal lands, a move designed to encourage development of renewable energy.

“Clean energy projects on public lands have an important role to play in reducing our nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and lowering costs for families,” Deb Haaland, the interior secretary, said in a statement.

Wind and solar developers have long said that lease rates and fees for projects on federal lands were too high to attract investors. The new policy would cut those costs by about 50 percent, administration officials said.

Representative Mike Levin, Democrat of California, who has sponsored legislation to expedite renewable energy development, applauded the move. “As Americans continue to face worsening effects of the climate crisis and rising energy bills, it’s paramount that we strengthen our clean energy independence to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs,” he said in a statement.

Ms. Haaland made the announcement during a trip to Las Vegas, where she hosted a renewable energy round-table with business groups. The federal Bureau of Land Management also announced that it would strengthen its ability to handle a growing number of applications by wind, solar and geothermal developers by creating five new offices across the West to review proposed projects.

The decision comes as the Biden administration also seeks to raise the royalty fees it charges oil and gas companies to drill on federal land and in federal waters. Last month, the administration canceled three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska, prompting Republican lawmakers to criticize the new renewable energy policies as harmful to energy producing states.

“Here is Biden‘s energy policy: wind, solar and wishful thinking,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said on Wednesday on the Senate floor. “It’s just not realistic and, among other things, it is hurting our country. It is hurting my people in Louisiana desperately.”

As a result, the administration is focused on more limited executive actions that could spur clean energy and reduce the use of oil, gas and coal — the burning of which produces the carbon dioxide and other gases that are dangerously heating the planet.

Last year, for example, the administration gave a green light to two major solar projects on federal lands in California that it said would generate about 1,000 megawatts, enough electricity to power about 132,000 homes.

In a report to Congress in April, the Interior Department said it was on track to approve 48 wind, solar and geothermal energy projects with the capacity to produce an estimated 31,827 megawatts of electricity, enough to power roughly 9.5 million homes, by the end of the fiscal 2025 budget cycle.

The reduction in fees and rental rates comes at a challenging time for the solar industry. A Commerce Department investigation into whether Chinese companies are circumventing U.S. tariffs by moving components for solar panels through four Southeast Asian countries has held up hundreds of new solar projects across the country."
5,DT_Doc2_Biden_More_Rewable.docx,"June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden rarely mentions electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) in public. But privately his administration has leaned on the company to help craft a new policy to allow electric vehicles (EVs) to benefit from the nation's lucrative renewable fuel subsidies, according to emails reviewed by Reuters.

The Biden administration contacted Tesla on its first day in office, marking the start of a series of meetings on the topic between federal officials and companies linked to the EV industry over the months that followed, according to the emails.

The administration's early and extensive outreach reflects that expanding the scope of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to make it a tool for electrifying the nation's automobile fleet is one of Biden's priorities in the fight against climate change.

The RFS, which dates back to 2005, is a federal program that requires transportation fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. Until now, it has been primarily a subsidy for corn-based ethanol.

The White House's outreach to Tesla also shows that, despite a public grudge match between Biden and Tesla founder Elon Musk, the Biden team tried early on to involve the carmaker in one of its key policy pushes. Biden has set a target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the RFS, is expected to unveil proposed changes to the policy sometime this year, defining new winners and losers in a multibillion-dollar market for credits, known as RINs, that has supported corn growers and biofuels producers for more than a decade.

Early signs are that the administration is leaning toward a rule that benefits carmakers like Tesla, giving them the greatest access to so-called e-RINS, or electric RINs. But the reform could also spread the subsidy to related industries too, like car charging companies and landfills that supply renewable biogas to power plants, according to industry players.

The idea of including electric vehicles in the RFS has been under consideration for years, but gained steam as Biden's transition team zeroed in on EVs as a job-friendly solution to the climate crisis. Transport accounts for more than a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

The current RFS requires oil refiners to blend ethanol and other biofuels into the fuel pool or buy RINs from those who do. That policy has spurred an economic boom in Farm Belt states. But it has also angered environmental groups who say the extra corn production damages land and water while prolonging the era of the internal-combustion engine.

Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, has voiced disapproval over an e-RIN program. The group sees the RFS as a policy that has failed to increase production of new generation lower-carbon fuels, while also harming the environment. It also sees expanding the program as a slippery slope toward increasing the use of feedstocks for wood and wood waste, which can generate electricity."
6,JAS_D0c1_Student_Loan_Forgiveness.docx,"After announcing last week that the emergency suspension of student loan repayments will be extended once more, Joe Biden and his left-wing allies are calling for a full student debt forgiveness plan. Inflation, according to the vast majority of Americans, is the country's most pressing issue.

After Biden's election, an ambitious student loan forgiveness program looked like a decent idea. Biden faced an uncertain economy and a Republican-controlled Senate that would likely oppose additional stimulus measures or back them only with regressive tax cuts. Student loan forgiveness sounded like a good opportunity to use the president's executive power to help people. 

Unexpected developments followed. First, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to enact a $900 billion stimulus measure during the lame-duck session to support Republican Senate candidates in Georgia. Both Republicans lost. The Biden administration presented Congress with a $1.8 trillion rescue plan. Then, a 50-50 Senate, led by moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, approved Biden's request.

This massive fiscal injection boosted demand in 2021, narrowing the output gap and causing inflation. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions supercharged pressure.

The Federal Reserve is engaging in an ongoing series of interest rate hikes. Increasing interest rates to curb demand also slows investment, hurting the economy's supply side.

Non-collection of student loans is counterproductive. The prolonged hiatus has saved student borrowers money due to canceled interest and inflation-related principal degradation. 

Restarting loan payments would drain some demand out of the economy, and would do so by disproportionately targeting those most able to pay.

Much of the left wants Biden to go in the opposite direction. Wisdom Cole, the national director of the NAACP’s youth and college division, urged him to “just cancel it” because “student loan debt is a racial and economic justice issue that stains the Soul of America.” Given current economic conditions in the U.S., this is an irresponsible approach. College graduates have seen their overall wealth soar during the pandemic, and the Federal Reserve’s survey of consumer finances shows that households with higher levels of student debt also have higher incomes.

Restarting student loan collections would contain inflation by hurting a high-income minority. Debt reduction would enhance inflation. Debt relief advocates used to recognize this logic. In June 2019, Representative Ilhan Omar called student debt relief “stimulus for working people across our country.” In April of that year, Senator Elizabeth Warren said it would “give our economy a boost.” The director of education, jobs and power at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning economic policy think tank, said in December 2020 that debt relief “can help stimulate the economy at a moment when we need economic stimulus.”

This analysis was accurate. Now, the opposite is true. Since then, the U.S. has legislated trillions in stimulus and witnessed a substantial turnaround in the labor market, while inflation has decreased student debt. The economy needs less consumer demand, not more.

Progressive interest in student debt is part of a larger critique of U.S. higher education financing. This reasoning is unaffected by macroeconomic fluctuations. The left should develop a parliamentary coalition for higher education finance reform.

Temporary student-loan forgiveness was conceived in different economic and political times, and its argument has been overtaken by events. Some limited forgiveness for low-income borrowers in severe straits may be justified, but it should be combined with debt collection from the wealthy majority. It's a fair way to lower inflation."
7,JAS_Doc2_Inflation-complicates_Biden.docx,"The rising cost of food, gasoline, and other basics complicates President Biden's discussion over whether to eliminate student loan debt for tens of millions of individuals. 

Mr. Biden has signaled to Democratic senators that he will definitely move through with student loan relief, but he is still pressuring his team for information about the economic repercussions of wiping off $10,000 of debt for some — or all — of the nation's 43 million federal student loan holders.

In discussions this spring, Mr. Biden called for more data on whether the move would benefit well-off private university borrowers who might not need the help. What would it imply for the economy if the government forgives $321 billion in loans with inflation at 8.6%? ""You're talking millions, maybe billions of money. Cedric Richmond, who resigned as Biden's senior adviser last month, advised caution. ""He wants to ensure equity and that inequities aren't exacerbated.""

 Political and economic ramifications of loan forgiveness divide the White House. Ron Klain, Mr. Biden's chief of staff, said it would galvanize young, frustrated voters. Other advisers said many Americans who saved for college would detest the move.

Some economic advisors have told Mr. Biden that the action may reduce inflation if he combines debt forgiveness with a resume of student loan interest payments, which were halted during the outbreak.

Biden's deliberations reflect his efforts to transcend country and party divisions. Biden is trying to balance his commitment to combat racial and economic inequality with concerns that debt forgiveness may worsen inflation and be regarded as a giveaway, hurting his image as a labor and working-class protector.

Biden's economic advisors think student debt forgiveness won't exacerbate inflation and could reduce price growth.

Biden is considering a student loan forgiveness framework that his economic advisors say won't exacerbate inflation and could alleviate price growth.

Under the plan, Mr. Biden would erase some debt for selected borrowers, perhaps up to $10,000 each. This would allow certain borrowers more money to spend on goods and services, including buying furniture or dining out, potentially driving up costs. Any debt relief would have income requirements.

This pauses all student loan interest payments, which was imposed in March 2020 and extended seven times, most recently until Aug. 31. Many borrowers would have to cut their spending to resume loan payments.

Biden's advisors fear the two proposals could reduce consumer spending. Some estimates say the two reforms could slightly reduce inflation. Aides say they'd cancel each other out.

Jared Bernstein, a White House economic adviser, said the net inflationary effect should be neutral if debt payment resumption and debt relief occur simultaneously.

According to the government, an inflation-neutral proposal would require less debt relief than liberal Democrats want from Biden.

Opponents say Biden should restart loan payments to prevent inflation. They feel the government is making inflation look better by resuming interest payments as a new policy that may counter debt cancellation, while the suspension was always designed to be temporary.

The White House would prefer Congress pass student loan relief legislation, but Senate Democrats lack the votes. Democrats want Biden to uphold his promise.

Democrats’ leaders, presented data to Mr. Biden showing that debt cancellation would benefit borrowers who failed to obtain a degree to rebut the notion that relief would be a giveaway to the privileged. Vice President Kamala Harris has also met with Mr. Biden to break down the groups that would benefit. Republicans are accusing the White House of budgetary irresponsibility"
8,JJ_Doc1_Consumers-Are-Feeling.docx,"US consumer sentiment hit a new record low in June amid growing concerns about inflation, according to a closely followed University of Michigan survey released Friday.

The final index reading of 50 in the monthly Surveys of Consumers was just below the preliminary reading of 50.2 released two weeks ago. The final June index -- a 14.4% drop since May -- represents the lowest recorded level since the university started collecting consumer sentiment data in November 1952.



Here's what the Fed rate hike means for your salary

""Consumers across income, age, education, geographic region, political affiliation, stockholding and homeownership status all posted large declines,"" said Joanna Hsu, Surveys of Consumers director, in a statement. ""About 79% of consumers expected bad times in the year ahead for business conditions, the highest since 2009.""



Inflation remained the biggest concern for consumers, she noted, adding that 47% of consumers blamed the sharp increase in prices for eroding their living standards. That is 1 percentage point below the all-time high reached during the Great Recession, according to the report.

""As higher prices become harder to avoid, consumers may feel they have no choice but to adjust their spending patterns, whether through substitution of goods or foregoing purchases altogether,"" Hsu said. ""The speed and intensity at which these adjustments occur will be critical for the trajectory of the economy.""



How does inflation affect my standard of living?

Households are expecting prices to run even higher this year and anticipate them to remain above the Fed's 2% target goal for the next five years, according to survey data. Consumers expect inflation to run at a rate of 5.3% during the next year and 3.1% for the next five years.

The year-ahead expectations were little changed from the preliminary reading and those of the recent months, Hsu said.



Still, consumers are feeling slightly more optimistic about longer-term inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market, the survey found.

More than half of consumers surveyed said they expect to see income growth during the next year, the survey found.



The record-low Michigan survey preliminary data released two weeks ago triggered a stock market plunge and likely factored in to the Fed's decision last week to raise rates by 75 basis points, up from a previously telegraphed 50 basis points.



The Fed's heightened sensitivity to the consumer survey puts additional weight on consumer sentiment and long-run inflation expectation readings and the external factors that could influence them -- including political advertisements, Goldman Sachs analysts said this week.

""High inflation is set to feature prominently in political advertisements ahead of the midterm elections in the next few months,"" analysts wrote in a research note published Thursday.



""As a result, we see the upcoming onslaught of inflation-focused political advertisements as adding to the risk that the Fed could continue to tighten aggressively even if economic activity decelerates sharply,"" according to the note."
9,JJ_Doc2_Why_Is_Inflation.docx,"Inflation Remains Enemy #1 for the Fed

Inflation has been the Federal Reserve‘s enemy number one in 2022, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made aggressive changes to U.S. monetary policy to bring inflation down to its long-term target of around 2%.

Several Fed governors have suggested multiple additional 50 basis point rate hikes may be appropriate to curb inflation. The May CPI number likely ensures the FOMC will continue to take an aggressive policy approach at the upcoming Fed meeting on June 14-15.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, says inflation was broad-based across many different categories, suggesting the problem is deeper than temporary disruptions from supply chain bottlenecks or the war in Ukraine.

“The Fed is going to face increasing pressure to get inflation under control and will need to raise interest rates by at least 50 bps at the next three meetings,” says Zaccarelli.

Could Inflation Help Spark a Recession?

The Fed is facing a difficult balancing act, needing to raise interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation without triggering a U.S. recession.

Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs for companies and consumers, weighing on economic activity. Up to this point, the U.S. labor market has been solid, but the S&P 500’s 18.6% year-to-date decline reflects concerns on Wall Street that the economy may not take spiking interest rates in stride.

Zaccarelli says that he does not anticipate a U.S. recession in 2022, but he recommends investors position their portfolios defensively for the time being.

“Because of those headwinds, we have maintained a defensive posture, with lower duration and higher quality in fixed income and lower beta, less growth and less high [price-to-earnings] exposure within equities,” he says.

Growth stocks are particularly sensitive to rising interest rates because fund managers typically use discounted cash flow models to determine their price targets for growth stocks. Future cash flows are considered less valuable when the discounted rate is higher.



So far in 2022, the Russell 1000 Growth Index is down 26.8%, while the Russell 1000 Value Index is down just 9.96%.

Rising interest rates have also hit the high-growth technology sector particularly hard. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is down 25% year to date.

Inflation isn’t necessarily bad news for every stock market sector, however. Soaring oil, natural gas and other commodity prices have helped energy sector stocks generate record profits in 2022. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) is up 54.3% so far this year amid broad-based market weakness.

John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica Bank Wealth Management, says inflation numbers are forcing investors to shift their focus from accommodative monetary policies to underlying fundamental valuation metrics.

“Persistent inflation requires investor acceptance that equity valuation is no longer supported by low market interest rates but dependent on earnings and income. We look for volatility to continue until equity markets accept that the Fed’s target rate gets to at least 3%, and not obsess over the magnitude of incremental moves at the next several policy meetings,” Lynch says."
10,JS_DOC_1_lives_will_be_saved.docx,"Joe Biden signs into law landmark gun control bill



The most significant US gun control bill in nearly 30 years has been signed into law by President Joe Biden.

It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat.

Congress approved the legislation with bipartisan support this week, following a spate of mass shootings.

""While this bill doesn't do everything I want, it does include actions I've long called for that are going to save lives,"" Mr Biden admitted.

In May shootings at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a primary school in Uvalde, Texas, left a total of 31 people dead.

As he signed the legislation on Saturday, Mr Biden said relatives of the victims expected the US government to do something. ""Well today, we did,"" he added.

The reforms include:

Tougher background checks for buyers younger than 21

$15bn (£12.2bn) in federal funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades

Funding to encourage states to implement ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat

Closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole"" by banning all those convicted of domestic abuse from owning a gun - not just those who are married to their victims or live with them.

President Biden, as well as gun safety groups, had pushed for bigger reforms - including banning assault weapons, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased.

The gunman in the Texas shooting is believed to have bought two semi-automatic rifles days after turning 18.

Where does US gun control go from here?

US gun control claims fact-checked

America's gun culture - in seven charts

The new legislation is also significant because it is the first time in decades that the reforms have received support from both Democrats and Republicans.

Historically, efforts to strengthen US gun laws have been blocked by the Republican party.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposed the bill, arguing that it would not stop the violence.







There are an estimated 393 million firearms currently in the US.

It has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's wealthy nations - more than 20,900 people have been killed in gun violence in the US this year, according to Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group.

But it is also a country where many cherish gun rights that are protected by the Constitution's Second Amendment.

The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994, banning the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity magazines - but it expired a decade later.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court struck down a New York law restricting who can legally carry a gun - effectively expanding gun rights.

Although polls indicate that most Americans support gun control efforts, many Republican senators represent states with large pro-gun communities.

And Republican voters whose support they need to win primary elections - the selection process within each party - are even more opposed to reform."

lJoe Biden on Saturday signed the most sweeping gun violence bill in decades, a bipartisan compromise that seemed unimaginable until a recent series of mass shootings, including the massacre of 19 students and two teachers at a Texas elementary school.

“Lives will be saved,” the president said at the White House. Citing the families of shooting victims, the president said, “Their message to us was to do something. Well today, we did.”

The House gave final approval on Friday, following Senate passage on Thursday, and Biden acted just before leaving Washington for two summits in Europe.



The legislation will toughen background checks for the youngest gun buyers, keep firearms from more domestic violence offenders and help states put in place red flag laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people adjudged to be dangerous.

Most of its $13bn cost will help bolster mental health programs and aid schools, which have been targeted in Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, and elsewhere in mass shootings.

Biden said the compromise hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators “doesn’t do everything I want” but “it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives”.

“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” said the president, who was joined by his wife, Jill, a teacher, for the signing.

He said they will host an event on 11 July for lawmakers and families affected by gun violence.

Biden signed the measure two days after the supreme court’s ruling striking down a New York law that restricted people’s ability to carry concealed weapons.

While the new law does not include tougher restrictions long championed by Democrats, such as a ban on assault-style weapons and background checks for all gun transactions, it is the most impactful firearms violence measure produced by Congress since enactment of a long-expired assault weapons ban in 1993.

Enough congressional Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the steps after recent rampages in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas. It took weeks of closed-door talks but senators emerged with a compromise.

Biden signed the bill just before he departed Washington for a summit of the Group of Seven leading economic powers – the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan – in Germany. He will travel later to Spain for a Nato meeting."
12,KN_Doc1_Biden-urges-G7.docx,"Biden urges G7 to stay together as leaders target Russian gold, oil price

U.S. President Joe Biden told allies to stay together against Russia as G7 leaders gathered for a summit dominated by war in Ukraine and its impact on food and energy supplies and the global economy.

At the start of the meeting, Britain, the United States, Japan and Canada moved to ban imports of Russian gold to tighten the sanctions squeeze on Moscow and cut off its means of financing the invasion of Ukraine. But it was not clear whether there was G7 consensus on the plan. Britain said the ban was aimed at wealthy Russians who have been buying safe-haven bullion to reduce the financial impact of Western sanctions. Russian gold exports were worth $15.5 billion last year.

The G7 leaders of Britain, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada, were also having ""really constructive"" talks on a possible price cap on Russian oil. A French presidency official said Paris would push for a price cap on oil and gas and was open to discussing a U.S. proposal.

The G7 leaders did agree to raise $600 billion in private and public funds for developing countries to counter China's growing influence and soften the impact soaring food and energy prices.

G7 host German Chancellor Olaf Scholz invited Senegal, Argentina, Indonesia, India and South Africa as partner nations at the summit. Many countries of the global south are concerned about the collateral damage from Western sanctions on Russia.

Oxfam and other campaign groups want G7 leaders to tax excessive corporate profits to help those hit by the food crisis, cancel debts of the poorest nations and to support developing countries in their battle against the food crisis and climate change.

An EU official said G7 countries would impress upon the partner countries that food price rises were the result of Russia's actions not Western sanctions.

Officials from Germany and Britain, are pushing for temporary waivers on biofuels mandates to combat soaring food prices. Germany expects the proposal to fail to secure G7 backing due to U.S. and Canadian resistance.

Western countries rallied around Kyiv when Russia invaded Ukraine in February, but more than four months into the war, that unity is being tested as soaring inflation and energy shortages rebound on their own citizens.

Biden thanked Scholz for showing leadership on Ukraine and said Russian President Vladimir Putin had failed to break their unity. The summit provides an opportunity for Scholz to demonstrate more assertive leadership on the Ukraine crisis. He vowed a revolution in German foreign and defense policy after Russia's invasion in February, but critics have since accused him of dragging his feet.

As missiles struck the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the G7 must respond with more weapons and tougher sanctions on Russia. 

The G7 leaders are also expected to discuss options for tackling rising energy prices and replacing Russian oil and gas imports, as well as further sanctions that do not exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis affecting their own populations. Soaring global energy and food prices are hitting economic growth in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, with the United Nations warning of an ""unprecedented global hunger crisis""."
14,MCD_Doc1_Biden-Oil-Reserve .docx,"Under growing pressure to bring down high energy prices, President Biden announced on Thursday that the United States would release up to 180 million barrels of oil from a strategic reserve to counteract the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

With midterm elections just months away, gasoline prices have risen nearly $1.50 a gallon over the last year, undercutting consumer confidence. And the cost of diesel, the fuel used by most farmers and shippers, has climbed even faster, threatening to push up already high inflation on all manner of goods and services.

“I know how much it hurts,” Mr. Biden said Thursday as he announced the plan. “As you’ve heard me say before, I grew up in a family like many of you where the price of a gallon gasoline went up, it was a discussion at the kitchen table.”

Mr. Biden has few tools to control commodity prices that are set on global markets, so he is turning to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, ordering the largest release since that emergency stockpile was established in the early 1970s. But the move will most likely have a modest impact because it cannot make up for all the oil, diesel and other fuels that Russia used to sell to the world but is no longer able to.



“Our prices are rising because of Putin’s action,” Mr. Biden added, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “There isn’t enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices, we need to have more oil supply right now.”

Mr. Biden’s plan, to release one million barrels of oil a day for 180 days, would represent roughly 5 percent of American demand and 1 percent of global demand. To put that in context, Russian oil exports are down about three million barrels a day. The U.S. benchmark oil price fell about 6 percent on Thursday.

The administration’s announcement came as Russia conveyed mixed signals about its aims for the war in Ukraine, now in its sixth week. Despite Kremlin claims that it was withdrawing from the outskirts of Kyiv, the capital, fighting continued in that area on Thursday, and Western officials said they saw little evidence of a Russian pullback.

“Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities, so we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,” the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said at a news conference.

Russian officials also said they would allow a respite for greater humanitarian access to the devastated southeast port of Mariupol, once home to 400,000 people, which has come to symbolize Russia’s battlefield tactic of indiscriminate destruction. Previous agreements for pauses in fighting around Mariupol have repeatedly broken down.



Largely as a result of the ceaseless war, energy experts expect oil prices to stay high for a while without big interventions like the U.S. reserve release.

Reaction from the oil industry to Mr. Biden’s announcement was muted. The reserve has mostly been used to increase the supply of oil during wars, foreign threats to energy supplies or natural disasters. Smaller reserve releases by the Biden administration starting late last year have had little impact on the prices that drivers and businesses pay for fuel.

“It will lower the oil price a little and encourage more demand,” said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil company. “But it is still a Band-Aid on a significant shortfall of supply.”"
15,MCD_Doc2_More-Biden-Oil.docx,"President Biden announced a plan Thursday to draw 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve — an unprecedented push to use the emergency stocks to try to take the edge off of soaring gasoline prices.



He said gas prices could drop by as much as 35 cents per gallon, but that it would depend on a number of factors, including how many barrels are released by allies holding oil reserves of their own. Prices average $4.22 per gallon for regular — up from $3.61 a month ago and $2.87 a year ago, according to AAA.



""I know gas prices are are painful, I get it. My plan is going to help ease that pain today,"" Biden said, referring to the surge in gas prices as ""Putin's price hike.""



""It's time to deliver true energy independence in America once and for all,"" the president said.



The plan to add up to 180 million barrels of U.S. oil reserves onto the market would be by far the biggest-ever draw from the emergency stockpile of oil, held underground in salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas.



In contrast, the administration tapped the stocks for 50 million barrels in November 2021, and an additional 30 million barrels at the beginning of this month — moves that had only temporary impacts on climbing prices.



But Biden said on Thursday that it's not clear how significantly gas prices will be affected by his decision to tap the reserve.



""How far down, I don't think anyone can tell,"" he said, noting that today's gasoline prices are based on purchases made in the past, so there could be a delay until prices actually drop.



Biden said prices could come down 10 cents to 35 cents per gallon, but he said much would depend on how many barrels are released by allies holding oil reserves. He estimated allies could release 30 million to 50 million barrels.



There were about 580 million barrels of oil in the U.S. reserves in February, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That means this new plan could draw down total reserves by about a third.



Price inflation — including painfully high gas prices — is a top issue for voters, and Democrats are concerned it could hurt them in the November congressional elections. Prices began rising a year ago as the economy picked up in the wake of the pandemic and have been extremely volatile since January, as it became clearer that Russia would invade Ukraine.



Republicans have sought to pin the blame for higher prices squarely on Biden. Biden and Democrats have deflected blame for rising oil prices on Russia, a major oil exporter whose shipments have been somewhat crimped by financial sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.



Poland says its ban on all Russian oil and gas imports is the most radical in Europe

While the United States has banned imports of Russian oil, most importers have not — but there have been some signs that transactions have been affected by shippers and insurers worried about stepping afoul of Western sanctions on Moscow."
16,MCD_Doc3_Even-More-Biden-Oil.docx,"The U.S. oil industry and President Joe Biden's administration are clashing over who is to blame for tight energy supplies that have driven up U.S. pump prices to record highs.



Big Oil blames the problem on Biden's tighter regulations and push for renewable energy, which it says threaten to constrain output. The White House says the U.S. drilling industry is quick to ask for concessions but slow to open the spigot when consumers need it.



""What permits do they need? I don't think they need an embroidered invitation to drill,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing on Wednesday.



U.S. oil prices have surged in recent months due to a rebound in demand from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and supply disruptions from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Even after falling sharply on Wednesday, U.S. crude settled at $108.70 a barrel, compared to about $75 at the end of 2021.



On Tuesday, Biden banned U.S. imports from Russia, the world’s third biggest producer. Traders around the globe had already been shunning shipments from the country since it invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow calls a ""special operation.""



Retail gasoline prices in the United States spiked to a record $4.17 a gallon this week, posing a major problem for the administration as it battles inflation ahead of the November mid-term elections.



The American Petroleum Institute, which represents U.S. oil companies, took the opportunity in a press release on Tuesday to ""urge policymakers to advance American energy leadership and expand domestic production to counter Russia’s influence in global energy markets.”



“It’s time now for the administration to partner with domestic energy producers to leverage America’s ability to produce more oil and gas and focus on pro-growth policies to benefit our economy and the world’s security,” said the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a pro-business lobby group.



Oil executives this week mentioned another factor that has limited production but has nothing to do with government: pressure from shareholders to hold back spending on exploration and drilling and boost investor returns through share buybacks and dividends.



The Biden administration has said it wants to decarbonize the nation’s economy by 2050, in part by transitioning off fossil fuels. It has sought to suspend issuing new federal oil and gas leases while it studies their climate impacts, an effort that has triggered a legal battle.



It has also said over the last few days that its policies are not hindering the oil industry’s production, noting this week that U.S. oil producers have more than 9,100 unused permits to drill on federal acres.



Drilling permits are still being issued for federal lands, according to Interior Department records, and the pace of approvals since Biden took office is faster than it was during the administration of Republican Donald Trump.



The administration noted that 90% of drilling takes place on private land that would be unaffected by delays in new federal leasing. It also said it wants more oil, not less.



""In this moment of crisis we need more supply,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told attendees at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston on Wednesday. ""Right now we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand.""



Indeed, oil production in the country is on the upswing. The Energy Information Administration has projected U.S. oil production will hit a record over 12.2 million barrels per day in 2023 as drillers ramp up output."
17,MRD_Doc1_Civil-Society-Groups.docx,"Civil society groups responded with disgust after the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to tack an additional $45 billion on top of President Joe Biden's already massive military spending request, bringing the total proposed budget for the coming fiscal year to a staggering $857.6 billion. 

The Biden administration's March request for $813 billion in military spending for Fiscal Year 2023 represented a $31 billion increase over the current level of $782 billion, which is already unprecedented.

During its closed-door markup of the National Defense Authorization Act, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved a bill with a topline budget of $847 billion—$817 billion of which is earmarked for the Pentagon. An additional $10.6 billion in national military spending falls outside the Senate panel's jurisdiction.

William Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, called the Senate panel's decision ""misguided.""

""The administration's proposal is already higher than spending at the peaks of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and over $100 billion more than at the height of the Cold War,"" Hartung said in a statement. ""Throwing more money at the Pentagon will not make us safer—it will just divert funds from addressing other urgent challenges""

Monica Montgomery, a research analyst, pointed out that the Senate committee's proposed $45 billion increase in military spending is equivalent to Biden's entire budget request for climate programs, demonstrating how ""Congress will value militarism and defense contractors over a livable future.""

""If Congress truly wants to keep people safe, they must start by rejecting this increase and investing taxpayer dollars in human wellbeing"" Tori Bateman, policy advocacy coordinator said in a statement.

Although a majority of U.S. voters are opposed to military spending in excess of $800 billion, earlier efforts to slash the Pentagon's budget have failed to gain support to pass the House or Senate thanks in part to lawmakers who receive significant amounts of campaign cash from the weapons industry, which benefits from constantly ballooning expenditures.

Roughly 55% of all Pentagon spending went to private-sector military contractors from FY 2002 to FY 2021, according to Stephen Semler of the Security Policy Reform Institute. ""If this privatization of funds rate over the last 20 years holds,"" Semler wrote, arms dealers will gobble up an estimated $407 billion in public money in FY 2022.

In the words of Win Without War president Stephen Miles, ""The Pentagon's ever-growing budget is quite simply a theft from American people enriching some of the wealthiest corporations in this country.""

Julia Gledhill, an analyst at the Project on Government Oversight's Center for Defense Information, concurred.

""This $45 billion increase isn't about national security or the American people,"" she added. ""It's about funneling money into the military-industrial complex.""

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Thursday that inflation was ""the first consideration"" in increasing the topline. He also cited the need to support Ukraine, replenish weapons sent to aid the country's fight against Russia, and fund military priorities not included in Biden's Pentagon request, Politico reported.

Experts, meanwhile, have documented how military spending has never moved in tandem with inflation. They have also warned that the nearly $60 billion worth of weaponry that Ukraine has already received from the U.S. is more likely to intensify the war than to advance peace, with arms manufacturers among the only beneficiaries of such prolonged suffering.

The Senate Armed Services Committee's move to increase U.S. military spending comes despite the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan following 20 years of war."
18,MRD_Doc2_Not-Even-Halfway.docx,"Not even halfway through 2022, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has already begun discussing the defense budget for fiscal year 2023. According to US media reports, the committee voted to pass the draft ""National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023"" a few days ago, requiring the US Congress to increase the defense budget by an additional $45 billion on the basis of the defense budget submitted by the White House.

According to the report, the increased budget of $45 billion is mainly used to purchase weapons and equipment for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, increase ammunition inventories and support the development and service of new cruise missiles and new warships.

Of course, $857.6 billion is not the final amount. Due to the large differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives on the defense budget for the 2023 fiscal year, there will be multiple hearings to continue to demonstrate the rationality of the above-mentioned draft.

The U.S. defense budget has been on an upward trend over the past decade, with an increase of even more than 10 percent in 2018. Biden promised at the beginning of the campaign that he would cut the defense budget after he took office, although it fell to 0.3% in 2021, the smallest increase in recent years.

But a year later, Biden gave up his original promise, and the US defense budget in 2022 will increase by 3.7%, re-entering the fast track. 

According to a report released by the Stockholm Peace Research Institute in Sweden, the U.S. defense budget accounts for nearly 40% of the world's total, and the countries that rank second to 10th in global military spending are no more than the United States.

The U.S. defense budget has been increasing year by year, and the fundamental reason is that it is trying to gain equipment advantages and operational advantages through huge capital investment, and continue to maintain U.S. hegemony.

In the past two years, the growth of the U.S. defense budget has shown two obvious features. First, it has increased investment in research and development of some strategic weapons and equipment, such as hypersonic missiles and nuclear weapons. The data shows that in the defense budget for fiscal year 2023, the U.S. hypersonic missile program received $4.7 billion in earmarked funding.

Another feature is to increase investment in certain strategic key areas. In June 2020, in order to better implement the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" formulated by Trump, the US Congress established a special fund of US$7 billion; In fiscal 2022, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative allocations reached $7.1 billion.

According to the American media, hypersonic missiles are one of the few weapons and equipment projects that the United States lags behind the two major competitors of China and Russia. The United States needs to catch up with China and Russia in a short period of time.

In addition, nuclear weapons continue to receive ""preferential treatment"". Only the two projects of the new generation of strategic nuclear submarines and the new generation of stealth strategic bombers have won special funds of 6.3 billion US dollars and 5 billion US dollars respectively."
19,PSJ_doc1_President_Biden_announced.docx,"President Biden announced on Sunday that the U.S. will mobilize $200 billion dollars of investment in global infrastructure projects in the next five years, as part of an effort by the world's leading democratic economies to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative. The overall investment, including G7 partners and private capital, aims to hit $600 billion over the next five years.

""This isn't aid or charity,"" Biden said, flanked by other G7 leaders on the sidelines of the summit in Germany. ""It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone, including the American people and the people of all our nations.""

The announcement is an official launch and a rebranding of what had been rolled out last year at the G7 in the UK as ""Build Back Better World,"" a play on Biden's domestic proposal that would have reshaped the U.S. economy but foundered in Congress. The effort is now called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII.

Biden said the G-7 would counter Chinese influence. This year, he'll try again

For nearly a decade, China has been focused on bridges, road, mining and other hard infrastructure projects in the developing world, which has been estimated at $1 trillion in total spending, though the true amount could be higher. The G7 initiative is funding projects in four major categories: clean energy, health systems, gender equality and information and communications technology.

Investments include the following:

$2 billion for a solar project in Angola, including solar mini-grids, home power kits and solar to power telecommunications

$600 million for a U.S. company to build a submarine telecommunications cable that will connect Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa, delivering high speed internet

Up to $50 million from the U.S. to the World Bank's Childcare Incentive Fund, which is also getting support from Canada, Australia and numerous foundations

$3.3 million in technical assistance from the U.S. to the Institut Pasteur de Dakar for development of an industrial-scale, multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal that could produce COVID-19 vaccines and others, in partnership with other G7 nations and the EU

""We collectively have dozens of projects already underway around the globe,"" Biden said, arguing that this effort will prove democracies can deliver, and with fewer strings attached than Chinese-funded infrastructure. ""It's a chance for us to share our positive vision for the future. And let communities around the world see themselves, see for themselves the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.""

The idea is to combine government funding with private capital from pension funds, private equity funds and insurance funds, among others.

""The public sector alone will not be able to close the huge gap we face in many parts of the world,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during his remarks at the launch event.

The idea of harnessing private investment to supplement public funding for needed projects in the developing world is not new. Neither is concern from leading democracies about China's growing influence in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But thus far, the results have been mixed at best, says Gyude Moore, a former minister of public works in Liberia."
20,PSJ_doc2_The_worlds_wealthiest.docx,"ELMAU, Germany — The world’s wealthiest democracies on Sunday announced a $600 billion global infrastructure initiative to counter China’s push to exert political and commercial influence through massive investments across emerging economies.



President Joe Biden was joined by other G-7 leaders in unveiling the group’s counterstrike at a summit in the German Alps.



Biden declared that “our nation and the world stand at a genuine inflection point in our history,” and added that the choices made in developing countries today would gird them against future shocks from climate change and pandemics and prepare them for the digital age.



The United States will aim to leverage a total of $200 billion for the program over the coming five years through a combination of federal financing and private sector investments. That adds to €300 billion already announced by the EU. Along with contributions from the other members, the overall target is to build a $600 billion scheme.



Biden never used the word “China,” but the rival on the other end of the race for global reach was clear, with the president declaring that when “democracies do all that we can offer,” they would triumph over autocracies.



“We’re offering better options for people around the world,” he said.



European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the aim was to present a “positive powerful investment impulse to the world to show our partners in the developing world that they have a choice.”



The infrastructure plan was first unveiled a year ago, at last year’s G7 in Britain, but little progress was made and the program has been renamed. In 2021, it was dubbed “Build Back Better World” after Biden’s legislative push, but the implosion of his domestic agenda has led to a new moniker: the “Partnership for Global Infrastructure.” That will also be the umbrella term that captures the EU and U.K.'s own programs.



The plan is meant to compete with China’s “Belt and Road Initiative,” which has tried to strengthen ties with the developing world, especially in Asia and Africa, by offering financing for large-scale projects such as roads, railways and ports. U.S. officials have consistently claimed that the nations that go into business with China end up with punishing debt and are offering the West’s plan as an alternative.



But much of the funding behind the new plan appears aspirational and seems to fall short of its lofty goals. The White House did announce Sunday a few early projects, including U.S. companies taking the lead on a solar power project in Angola, a vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal, a modular reactor in Romania, and a 1,000-mile submarine telecommunications cable that will connect Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa.



The partnership will also provide a structure for the G-7 nations to combine their resources in offering emerging economies cash to turn off their coal plants. The first of these so-called Just Energy Transition Partnerships is being rolled out in South Africa — others are under discussion in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Senegal. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that Berlin’s contribution to South Africa would amount to €300 million."
21,SS_Doc1_job_growth_double-edged_sword.docx,"President Joe Biden faces a paradox that no recent predecessor has: Booming job growth can signal problems, as well as benefits, for American workers.

The Labor Department's new employment report makes plain the continuing benefits of the economy's strong, speedy recovery from the pandemic catastrophe. The economy added 431,000 jobs in March and 95,000 more than previously recognized for January and February. That brought average job gains over the first three months of this year to 562,000.

Wages continued to rise at an annual rate of more than 5%. The unemployment rate dipped once again to 3.6%. Demand for workers has been strong enough, and pandemic threats tempered enough, to lure back many Americans who had earlier dropped out of the labor force.

""Record job creation, record unemployment decline, record wage gains,"" Biden declared as he celebrated the data at the White House. ""People are making more money, they're finding better jobs, and -- after decades of being mistreated and paid too little -- more and more Americans now have real power now to get better wages.""

But spiking inflation, which Biden acknowledged, has dramatically altered the context for those gains.

In the four decades since the Federal Reserve squeezed inflation out of the economy in the early 1980s, the threat of dangerously rising prices became a distant memory. When Biden served as vice president under Obama, annual inflation never reached even 3.5%.

Now inflation is running at an annual rate of nearly 8%. The paychecks of American workers are not keeping up despite those rising wages. Moreover, the fact that employers keep hiring so many workers reflect pressure for inflation to continue. Businesses need more workers as they struggle to meet consumer demand for goods and services.

So long as they can't keep up, prices will keep rising. And that sours the mood of Americans on the economy and Biden alike.

In part, the President has been victimized by circumstances. The challenge of restarting the economy after disruptive pandemic shutdowns has made it harder for businesses to supply what consumers want to buy. The rate of inflation has risen throughout the developed world.

The challenge has been exacerbated by pandemic-induced changes in the patterns of consumer purchases. The administration's assiduous efforts to ease supply chain backups at ports and internal transportation hubs can help only at the margins.

Now the war in Ukraine has introduced a new set of inflation pressures, most conspicuously in rising prices for gasoline. White House attempts to label this ""Putin's price hike"" don't ease motorists pain, though the massive release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Biden announced this week may temper further increases this year.

At the same time, Biden and Democrats in Congress have themselves contributed to the problem in a way that illustrates the double-edged sword of 2022 economic news.

Even critics acknowledge that the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan they pushed through last year accelerated the economic recovery. That has helped generate, and sustain, impressive job gains.

But Biden's allies also acknowledge that the rescue plan also fueled inflation. Features like its $1,400 relief checks and expanded, refundable child tax credits stimulated the consumer demand that businesses can't keep up with.

That assistance may have also contributed to inflation-producing labor shortages by allowing some Americans to take their time returning to the work force."
22,SS_Doc1_Mission_Not_Yet.docx,"When Biden was last in Europe, just weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, his task was to pull together an uncertain alliance stunned by Vladimir Putin’s onslaught and heartened by Kyiv’s unexpected success in resisting it.

The president must convince other leaders, their economies battered by surging inflation, to keep funneling money and weapons to Ukraine instead of keeping them at home.

Biden will have two stops in Europe after Air Force One lifts off from Joint Base Andrews on Saturday: first, Germany for the G-7 summit and then a NATO gathering in Spain.

Biden says Putin ‘cannot remain in power’ in Poland speech

The agenda, according to the White House, is geared toward displaying support for Ukraine while trying to manage the disruptions the war has caused to the global economy, namely in energy and food prices. The president plans to once again support Finland and Sweden’s bids for NATO membership while working to assuage Turkey’s objections. The White House suggested that Biden would also champion a global infrastructure initiative and hinted that more sanctions on Russia may be unveiled.

“He came into office with the express purpose of revitalizing and reinforcing our allies and partnerships around the world and that’s what he has done,” said John Kirby of the White House’s National Security Council. “He has elevated these partnerships to meet the central challenges of our time.”

When Biden visited Brussels and Poland in March, he pushed Europe to balance the moral and geopolitical imperative to act on behalf of Ukraine along with the fears of further escalating the conflict and the economic costs of implementing an aggressive sanctions regime against Russia.

The West unleashed a punishing array of sanctions against Russia and rendered Putin a pariah on the world stage. Moscow’s hopes for a lightning decapitation of Kyiv failed, and the bonds between the Western nations tightened. Much to Moscow’s fury, a debate over expanding NATO to include Sweden and Finland is poised to dominate the alliance’s summit in Madrid.

But Putin didn’t abandon his war. Though the Russian military suffered immense casualties, Moscow redirected its efforts on Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where its supply lines are shorter and the Red Army could better exploit its overwhelming numbers. With brutal violence, Russia has made slow but undeniable progress, prompting Kyiv to urgently call for more weapons as its losses mount.

But as the war grows deadlier, strains have been begun to show among the allies.

Though Washington has authorized tens of billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine, there have been questions about whether some countries, namely Germany, have contributed their fair share to Kyiv. Russia’s blockage of Ukraine’s ports has contributed to soaring food prices now exacerbating the pandemic-fueled inflation gripping much of the world. And the sanctions against Russia, as well as bans on part of its energy sector, have led to surging gas prices.

Some in Europe have tried to nudge Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, believing that a brokered resolution could spare lives and stabilize economies. But Zelenskyy has refused to cede any territory to Putin, particularly after evidence of Russian war atrocities, creating a sense that the conflict in the east could last months if not years.

“The United States needs to send a unified message of developed democracies’ support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s participation in the Summit should underscore that point,” said Jeff Rathke, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, “especially if the US and its Allies can show progress through new material commitments or measures to impose new consequences on Russia.”"
23,SS_Doc2_A_New_Task.docx,"Biden returns to Europe on Saturday night at a moment when everything about the war is harder. While Russia’s oil exports have fallen precipitously, its revenues have actually been on the rise, a function of soaring fuel prices. 

So Biden must prepare his allies for a grinding conflict amid shocks in the food and energy markets, and inflation on a scale few imagined six months ago. Not surprisingly, a few cracks are already emerging, as popular discontent, and coming elections, begin to worry allied leaders.

John F. Kirby, told reporters on Thursday to expect new measures to “target the Russian defense supply chain and continue cracking down on the evasion of these unprecedented sanctions” — seemingly a warning to China and India, which have continued to buy discounted Russian oil.

The White House is also planning to announce new steps to bolster NATO’s capabilities, including a new “strategic concept” for the alliance, the first in a dozen years.

But the looming issue will be how to deal with Putin, at a moment Russia has been recast from a fellow European power to a pariah state. When France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said in May that the West should resist “the temptation of humiliation” of Mr. Putin, it was among the first public signs of a rift in the fundamental strategy of how far to push the Russian leader, short of sending NATO troops into the fight — a step that Mr. Biden and other NATO leaders say they have no intention of taking.

“Compared to the March trip, Biden faces a heightened degree of trade-offs between domestic and foreign policy objectives,” said Richard Fontaine. “His priority will be to increase pressure on Russia and aid to Ukraine, but to do so when the West is worried about oil and food prices, its remaining weapons stocks and a war that shows no end in sight.”

For now, Biden is under little political pressure at home to back away. 

Biden is constantly weighing whether new weapons — like the advanced artillery that just arrived on the battlefield or the advanced drones that the White House is now considering — would escalate the war too fast and give Putin another justification for retaliation. 

Hovering over the two meetings will be this perilous moment for the global economy. Inflation has flared across the United States and Europe, driven by the supply-chain disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic; a surge of consumer demand as economies have reopened; and, in recent months, a spike in food and energy prices caused by the Russian invasion. Rapid price increases have hurt workers and families across the Group of 7 nations and eroded their leaders’ standing in the polls — particularly Biden’s.

The leaders will be hard-pressed to find quick and concrete ways that they can work together to help relieve that economic and political pain. They are set to discuss infrastructure investment and other ways to unsnarl global supply chains; new steps to counter trade practices by China that American leaders and others call predatory; and a range of issues surrounding inflation. But all fear that interest rate increases could be a prelude to a recession.

Perhaps most urgently for Biden, the leaders are expected to discuss ways to bring down global oil prices, including possible changes to how European nations have sought to hurt Russia’s oil export business.

So far, Biden administration efforts to find a pathway out of Ukraine for its farm products have failed. Russia is doing what it can to tighten the noose, in what appears to be an effort to bring President Zelensky’s country to economic collapse."
24,SS_Doc2_inflation_impacts_Student-Loan-Forgiveness.docx,"Biden still is deciding whether to enact wide-scale student loan cancellation for millions of student loan borrowers. In late April, Biden said he would announce his decision within weeks. However, that date has passed, and student loan borrowers are wondering what’s next for student loans. With inflation currently higher than 8%, how will the highest inflation in 40 years impact Biden’s decision on student loan forgiveness? 

Let’s explore.

Student loan forgiveness: impact on inflation

Inflation has been driven largely by post-pandemic demand, supply chain shortages and the conflict in Ukraine. Critics of wide-scale student loan forgiveness say student loan forgiveness is a large financial distribution to millions of student loan borrowers. As these student loan borrowers gain new-found cash flow, they likely will spend it. Critics fear that this incremental spending could increase inflation.

Comparison to stimulus checks

Some critics of broad student loan forgiveness argue that wide-scale student loan forgiveness, like stimulus checks in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, represents large-scale spending that increases inflation. While stimulus checks included upfront money, student loan forgiveness would be spread out over time. For example, $10,000 of student loan cancellation doesn’t mean student loan borrowers will get a $10,000 check to pay off student loans. Rather, student loan cancellation means student loan borrowers would not have to make their student loan payment each month for the remaining duration of their student loans, which could save borrowers a few hundred dollars monthly, for example. So, the timing of distributions is different for student loan forgiveness (over time) and stimulus checks (upfront), which can impact the economy differently.

Student loan forgiveness: stimulate the economy

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has said that wide-scale student loan forgiveness will stimulate the economy. More government spending will increase consumer demand when it should be lowered to combat inflation.

Student loan cancellation: research says inflation would increase

According to research from the Committee for a Responsible Budget (CFRB), a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization, wide-scale student loan forgiveness would increase inflation. The CFRB says that student loan cancellation of $1.6 trillion of student debt, for example, would “increase the inflation rate by between 10 and 50 basis points (0.1 to 0.5 percentage points) in the 12 months after repayment is scheduled to begin.” Practically, this would lower student loan payments by $80 billion and increase consumption by $70 billion to $95 billion. That said, Biden is not considering canceling all student loan debt. If Biden cancels $10,000 of student loans or reconsiders $50,000 of student loan debt, for example, the potential inflationary impact could be less. However, critics say the economy can’t adequately handle increased consumer demand from wide-scale student loan forgiveness.

Will Biden cancel student loans?

Will your student loans get canceled? Biden, who has canceled $25 billion of student loans, will weigh the substantives advantages and disadvantages of wide-scale student loan cancellation. Importantly, he doesn’t want student loan forgiveness to be the worst mistake of his presidency. However, beyond substantive considerations, Biden will assess how voters perceive student loan forgiveness and inflation. With high gas and food prices, Biden could decide that wide-scale student loan forgiveness isn’t worth the political capital if inflation continues to climb between now and the midterm election. If this happens, Biden could still focus on targeted student loan cancellation."

27,Sieminski_Doc2_Recession.docx,"President Joe Biden told The Associated Press on Thursday that the American people are ""really, really down"" after a tumultuous two years with the coronavirus pandemic, volatility in the economy and now surging gasoline prices that are slamming family budgets.
He said a recession is not inevitable and bristled at claims by Republican lawmakers that last year's COVID-19 aid plan was fully to blame for inflation reaching a 40-year high, calling that argument ""bizarre.""
Speaking to the AP in a 30-minute Oval Office interview, Biden addressed the warnings by economists that the United States could be headed for a recession.
As for the causes of inflation, Biden flashed some defensiveness on that count. ""If it's my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I'm not being a wise guy,"" he said.
The president said he saw reason for optimism with the 3.6% unemployment rate and America's relative strength in the world.
Biden's bleak assessment of the national psyche comes as voters have soured on his job performance and the direction of the country. Only 39% of U.S. adults approve of Biden's performance as president, according to a May poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research, dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier.
Overall, only about 2 in 10 adults said the U.S. is heading in the right direction or that the economy is good, both down from about 3 in 10 in April. Those drops were concentrated among Democrats, with just 33% within the president's party saying the country is headed in the right direction, down from 49% in April.
Biden spun out the possibility of chaos in Europe if an unimpeded Russia kept moving deeper into the continent, China was emboldened to take over Taiwan and North Korea grew even more aggressive with its nuclear weapon ambitions.
Biden renewed his contention that major oil companies have benefited from higher prices without increasing production as much as they should. He said the companies needed to think of the world in the short term, not just their investors.
Consumer prices have jumped 8.6% over the past year, the steepest rise in more than 40 years. Republican lawmakers have said that Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year kick-started a spiral of price increases.
The president said there was ""zero evidence"" for that claim, noting that other countries have endured higher prices as economies reopened and people became vaccinated. Still, Biden acknowledged Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's contention that the spending had a limited inflationary effect.
Still, high inflation has created a conundrum for Biden. He prioritized bringing back millions of jobs and has seen the unemployment rate return to close to pre-pandemic levels. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday increased its benchmark interest rate, in hopes of slowing the economy and pulling inflation down to its target rate of 2%.
The tightening of Fed policy has caused financial markets to slump and led many economists to warn of a potential recession next year. The president encouraged Americans to stay patient.

28,Sieminski_Doc1_Inflation.docx,"Until a few days ago many thought America would be inhabiting that other world. Alas, a brutal batch of data has awoken them to a more dispiriting reality. Inflation, far from peaking, seems to be gaining altitude, with potentially dramatic consequences for the Fed, for investors and for American politics.
On June 10th the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported that the consumer-price index in May was 8.6% higher than a year earlier, the fastest annual rate of inflation since 1981. More concerning was the momentum. Month on month, consumer prices rose by 1%, well above the 0.3% increase in April.
Adding to the grim news was a plunge in consumer sentiment to a record low, as measured by a closely watched survey from the University of Michigan. The principal cause was stubbornly high inflation. Consumers now expect an average inflation rate of 3.3% over the next five to ten years, up from their expectation of just 3% a month earlier. This does not yet mean that inflation expectations are “unanchored”—a much-dreaded condition that could set the stage for an upward spiral in prices—but it certainly is enough to stir fear at the Fed. The broadening of inflationary pressures, from goods such as cars and electronics to wages and rental costs, darkens the backdrop. And motorists will have noticed the surging price of petrol, which, for the first time ever, now exceeds $5 a gallon.
Such restraint now seems off the table. Instead, market pricing has shifted in a far more hawkish direction. Most investors now think the Fed will raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on June 15th, at the conclusion of a regular rate-setting meeting. The last time that the Fed delivered such a jumbo rate rise was in 1994 under Alan Greenspan. Moreover, many expect that the Fed will follow up with yet another three-quarter-point increase at its next meeting in July and then a half-point in September. That would make for the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980s.
The prospect of the central bank slamming on the monetary brakes has unnerved markets. 
For Mr Biden’s administration, the economic frustrations are only deepening. 
On the other hand, American voters will not be so forensic in their analysis of price trends, nor so forgiving in their assessment of Mr Biden’s responsibility. Just over 500 days into his presidency, 49% of Americans disapprove of his performance, while 41% approve, according to weekly opinion polls conducted by The Economist and YouGov. That negative gap of eight percentage points puts Mr Biden in a weak position at this point in the electoral cycle (albeit in a slightly better one than Donald Trump at the same time in his presidency).
Mr Biden has tried to direct attention to the millions of jobs recovered over the past year as America claws its way back from the pandemic. But the soaring cost of living and the rising prospect of recession are instead top of mind.
